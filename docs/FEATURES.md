## Technical Improvements

### Network Infrastructure

#### Dynamic RPC Management
```typescript
// Enhanced networkUtils.ts
export const getNetworkConfig = (chainId: number) => {
  const configs = {
    // Ethereum
    1: { rpc: 'https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/...', name: 'Ethereum' },
    11155111: { rpc: 'https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/...', name: 'Sepolia' },
    // Base
    8453: { rpc: 'https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...', name: 'Base' },
    84532: { rpc: 'https://base-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/...', name: 'Base Sepolia' },
    // Scroll
    534352: { rpc: 'https://scroll-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/...', name: 'Scroll' },
    534351: { rpc: 'https://scroll-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/...', name: 'Scroll Sepolia' }
  };
  return configs[chainId] || configs[1]; // Default to Ethereum
};
```
